# Database-Exploration-with-MySQL
#SITUATION:

I and my rich uncle, Jimmy just purchased Maven Movies, a brick and mortar, a DVD rental business. Uncle Jimmy put up the money while i run the day-to-day operations of the business.

#BRIEF: As a new owner, I need to learn everything I can about the business: the products, inventory, staff, customer purchase behaviours, etc.

I have access to the entire Maven Movies SQL database, but the remaining employees are not able to give much direction. I will need to analyze everything on my own.

#OBJECTIVE: Use MySQL to:

Access and explore the Maven Movies database.

Develop a firm grasp of the 16 database tables and how they relate to each other.

Analyze all aspects of the company's data, including transactions, customers, staff, etc.
