# Database Exploration with MySQL

## Situation

I and my rich uncle, Jimmy just purchased Maven Movies, a DVD rental business. Uncle Jimmy put up the money while i run the day-to-day operations of the business.

## Brief 

As a new owner, I need to learn everything I can about the business: the products, inventory, staff, customer purchase behaviours, etc.

I have access to the entire Maven Movies SQL database, but the remaining employees are not able to give much direction. I will need to analyze everything on my own.

## Objective

Use MySQL to:

1. Access and explore the Maven Movies database.

2. Develop a firm grasp of the 16 database tables and how they relate to each other.

3. Analyze all aspects of the company's data, including transactions, customers, staff, etc.
